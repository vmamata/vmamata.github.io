My portfolio.

**Hidden tool:**
Option beta-color theme "Outrun" added. To access, type "https://viratsingh.me?outrun".

To test more general colors, add "?<colorName>" at the end of the URL to change the secondary text color to whatever you want!
For example, "https://viratsingh.me?red" will have the secondary text color set to red. This only works for real color values, so adding a non-color value will keep the default secondary color, which is blue.
